Michael Grubb's Dot Files
=========================

These are configuration files to configure my environment.

Installation
------------

    brew install yadm 
      or https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/docs/install
    yadm clone git://github.com/mgrubb/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Environment
-----------

I am running on Mac OS X, and while it should work with other *NIX environments, it will likely
requires a bit of tweaking. My primary shell is Korn shell (ksh).  I try to write portable shell
scripts however.
