Michael Grubb's Dot Files
=========================

These are configuration files to configure my environment.

Installation
------------

    brew install chezmoi
    mkdir ~/.local/share
    git clone git://github.com/mgrubb/dotfiles.git ~/.local/share/chezmoi
    cd ~/.local/share/chezmoi
    chezmoi init

Environment
-----------

I am running on Mac OS X, and while it should work with other *NIX environments, it will likely
requires a bit of tweaking. My primary shell is now Bash.  I try to write portable shell
scripts however.
