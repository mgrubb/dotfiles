1. Increasing/Decreasing Lists		*Inc*

1.1 Getting Started

The "increment" plugin makes easy creating lists with incremented or decremented
numbers.  Here is an example:

This is line @
This is line @
This is line @
This is line @
This is line @

The "@" character (the default) acts as a placeholder for the number.  The "Inc"
command substitues the pattern with the desired sequence of numbers.  By typing
":1,5Inc", one obtains:

This is line 0
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
This is line 4

1.2 Changing the increment pattern

To change "@" with "zorglub", have the following lines handy:

This is line zorglub
This is line zorglub
This is line zorglub
This is line zorglub
This is line zorglub

then type ":1,5Inc pzorglub":

This is line 0
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
This is line 4

1.3 Changing the increment value

To change the value of the increment from 1 to 5, add "i5" to the command.  You
just have to type ":1,5Inc pzorglub i5".  The result is:

This is line 0
This is line 5
This is line 10
This is line 15
This is line 20

1.4 Changing the starting value

To change the starting value from 0 to 100, add "s100" to the command.  You just
have to type ":1,5Inc pzorglub i5 s100".  The result is:

This is line 100
This is line 105
This is line 110
This is line 115
This is line 120

The order of the optional arguments does not matter, so you could also have typed
":1,5Inc s100 i5 pzorglub".  Also, the lines with incrementable patterns may be
located sparsely throughout the file:

This is line @
Garbage text in between
More garbage text in between
...
Stupid comments still in between
This is line @
And final comments

With "%Inc s1", the above text becomes:

This is line 1
Garbage text in between
More garbage text in between
...
Stupid comments still in between
This is line 2
And final comments

Better yet...  With ":Inc i11 s4",

This is a list: [@, @, @, @, @, @, @]

becomes

This is a list: [4, 15, 26, 37, 48, 59, 70]

Happy vimming!
